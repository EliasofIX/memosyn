MemoSyn: Your Simple Keyboard-Dedicated Second Brain
Hello, fellow keyboards, to an oasis for those who long for peace in computer note taking, drawn from beauty in simplicity at dingboard.com and brilliant minds at @yacineMTB. Productivity intensity and a peaceful, minimalist's book in one.

Philosophy
Where software bellows with a chorus of options, MemoSyn is a whisperer. It's a note taking app, but not in your traditional view of one. Not about what all you can, but about how little you have to.
The epitome of refinement is simplicity. Shedding din, providing only that which is enough for rapid-fire note taking with your keyboard, is our mantra.
Mastering your keys. Let your fingers become your doorway to productivity and creation. MemoSyn is crafted in its origin for keyboards, keeping your use of a mouse at an absolute minimum in order to maintain your flow.
Master of disorder. By having your notes locally stored, your information is in your hands, your security and performance at your fingertips, not in a cloud somewhere in between.

Inspiration
MemoSyn takes its character from:

Dingboard.com: In an ocean of unnecessary software, dingboard is a guiding light, a lesson in getting more out of less. Purpose over tool.
@yacineMTB
: A wizard at crafting tools that combine efficiency with beauty. How one works with one's environment encouraged him to make a difference, and in a similar way, MemoSyn looks for an integration with one's mind, an extension, in fact, of one's thinking.
Features
Keyboard-Dedicated Workflow: Navigate, make, edit, and organize your notes with your fingers, not a single button press, ever.
Vim-Like Commands and Shortcuts: All at your fingertips, for your ease and comfort, and for your productivity, naturally.
Instant Save: What you're thinking, saved in an instant, with locally stored files for speed and discretion.
Search and Replace: Search your storehouse of knowing with ease, or reformat your thinking in real-time with powerful search.
Export Your Brain: To share or backup, simply export your memos in a readable, tidy form.

Getting Started
Nothing to download, nothing to replicate: 

Go to memosyn.tech.
Type away. That's it. Hit Ctrl+N (or Cmd+N, for all macsters out there) to start a new note and let your fingers fly over your keys.

Contributing
Not your run-of-the-mill storehouse, even though it sits in GitHub Pages. Contribute nevertheless:
Feedback: Report a bug, request a feature, via GitHub's Issues.
Code Contributions: Have improvement ideas?
Fork the site source repo (should one even have one yet?), make your tweaks, and submit them for review via a pull request.
Optims in key nav, performance, or additional Vim-inspired commands particularly valued.

Roadmap
idk yet, write me and I might add it

MIT License - Do whatever, modify, and pass it along. Don't forget whence it sprang into existence, though!

Join the Zen
Are you tired of all the din, believe in simplicity, or wonder simply how little can go a long, long distance with your fingers and your keys? Come join and let's redefine taking a note, in its quiet, efficient way, for a change.

Good noting, friends. Let your thinking run free, and with a freedom, your keystrokes, no less!

Recall, in wise words of
@yacineMTB
, "too many people restrict the amount of actions they have available to them. just ignore everything telling you you cannot do things. why?

also this entire thing was programmed by chatgpt4o, claude sonnet 3.5, grok 2 (underrated for coding actually)
