memosyn | your mind, multiplied

I like second brain software like Obsidian and Notion, those are great products. However, you sometimes don't feel like your data is your data and sometimes you also prefer the simplicity of using a text editor only with your keyboard, it's simply faster, I mean that's literally one of the reasons that VIM and NVIM are so beloved.
But stuff like that simply doesn't exist in the world of second brain software, how does memosyn work?

To ensure that your files are truly your files, they get saved in the LocalStorage of your browser, you can export them by hitting the settings button, which is not usable by keyboard (yet) and clicking the button "export all files", you then download a zip file of your files (they are in .txt format), in the future I also want to add capability to upload .txt files and export single files. 

How do you use it?
You first visit the website: https://eliasofix.github.io/memosyn/ (I will soon buy a domain for that, preferably memosyn dot tech)
You name the file by typing the name and placing a colon after it, for example "file:" and the name will be "file".
You then type what you want to type into that file hit (on mac ctrl on windows alt) + s to save the file, to open a new file it's ctrl/alt + n and to search through your files it's ctrl/alt + f, the searchbar is macOS spotlight inspired and you navigate it by typing, the arrow keys and the enter button
